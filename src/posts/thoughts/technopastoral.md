I've already re-written this site twice. It looks like that's going to be a yearly tradition for me. The first rewrite replaced the `foamy-js` templating system with a more basic one based on MDX. For this latest
rewrite, I've done everything over in Svelte.

A few of the interesting interactive pages are a bit more interactive now. I especially had fun updating my ["Thoughts on Colors"](colors) post.

I've added so much to this site since starting it a few months ago. I really like this format and the free-flowing nature of the site's navigation. I've wanted to share my thoughts for a while now and it's great to finally feel enabled to do so. If you haven't already, go read [The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral][technopastoral] and start your own digital garden.
