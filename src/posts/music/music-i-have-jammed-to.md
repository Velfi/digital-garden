This is an eclectic collection, in no particular order, of music I have enjoyed.
Rather than sharing Spotify or Tidal links, all of the music below should be
accessible without creating any sort of account.

My hope is that you'll find something to like that's unlike what you're
currently liking. Good luck!

[soma fm](https://somafm.com/player/) is my perennial favorite, so it gets
permanent first billing. I've been listening to their stations since I was a
teen. I listen to the *Secret Agent* and *Illinois Street Lounge* stations the
most.

- [Cumbias Chichadélicas: Peruvian Psychedelic Chicha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhgnxSSc8gQ)
  - Good for dancing.
- [Partita in C Minor, BWV 826, Johann Sebastian Bach, Karmen Grubisic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmljDiP3mq0)
- [Acidjazzed Evening (as it's supposed to be played)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtUVC11ba4g)
- ["Le gibet", Ravel, Alice Sara Ott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-Cz8MOxaVc)
  - My favorite Ravel song. "A view of the desert, where the lone corpse of a
    hanged man on a gibbet stands out against the horizon, reddened by the
    setting sun. Meanwhile, a bell tolls from inside the walls of a far-off
    city, creating the deathly atmosphere that surrounds the observer."
- [After The Love Has Gone, Earth, Wind & Fire, Marcin Grochowina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIpo8L6EsE)
  - I love this person's covers. The play a vintage Rhodes Mark V electric piano
    that is so beautiful.
- [TRON Anthem For Keyboard Solo, Wendy Carlos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YojlUghGk8)
  - Oh Wendy. I wish I had written her some fan mail while she was still
    accepting it.
- [Little Person, Jon Brion/Charlie Kaufman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA_ubhYgjAc)
  - I'd like to recommend "Synecdoche, New York" to more people but I get why
    it's not to most people's tastes. If you can't sit through the movie, you
    can at least enjoy this song.
- [Toxic, Britney Spears, The Surfrajettes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAyeVjnJg9E)
- [Ben Webster Plays Ballads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3ipWLgg0nc)
- [Solace - A Mexican Serenade, Scott Joplin, Joshua Rifkin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KsF8-32rwI)
- [Beauty And The Beast, Wayne Shorter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQKnjwlN6g)
- [Jimmy's Walk, Barbara Dennerlein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYP7Mxss3_U)
  - Barbara Dennerlein is my favorite organist. She's so talented! The entire
    time she's playing the melody with her hands, she's also playing the
    bassline with her feet! For a similar present-day talent, see DOMi of DOMi &
    JD Beck.
- [Gokumon-to 獄門島 Soundtrack - Shinichi Tanabe 田辺信](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOyUBpEfC0w)
  - A soundtrack to one of a series of Japanese detective movies from the 70's.
    The others are good too, but this one is my favorite.
- [Off Minor, Thelonius Monk, Cedar Walton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IJElKZweYs)
