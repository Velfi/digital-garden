This font is a reimagining of my pixel font Rudras. It's free to use under the
Creative Commons license.

The pixel font is based on the font used in a fan translation of _Rudra no Hihou_,
a SNES game developed by Square. I don't know what that one was based on.

This one tries to respect the odd choices made by the author of that original
font while turning it into a more traditional typeface.

I hope you like it.
