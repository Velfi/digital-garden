A collection of art generators that can export SVGs. I purchased an [AxiDraw V3] and it's been a lot
of fun. Feel free to use these generators to make your own art. Running it requires you to have Rust
installed. To export SVGs, set the `SVG_EXPORT_DIRECTORY` environment variable (you can create an
`.env` file in the project root to set this as well).

## Generators

### Line Groups

Run it with this command: `cargo run release --bin line_groups`

![Groups of wavy lines overlaid on top of each other at regular intervals](/images/programming/plotlings/line_groups.svg)
The first one I created for this project. It generates groups of lines that look neat. It can also
look similar to a [ridgeline plot].

### Maze

Run it with this command: `cargo run release --bin maze`

![An unsolvable maze](/images/programming/plotlings/maze.svg)
Based on the classic [maze BASIC program].

### Dune

Run it with this command: `cargo run release --bin dune`

I had a link to [Sohan's page][Sohan Murthy's Continuity Correction] here, but it broke and I can't
find the original artwork anymore.

### Line Noise

Run it with this command: `cargo run release --bin line_noise`
