This is a companion project that I worked on while reading Stephen Wolfram's "A New Kind of Science".

It contains Rust implementations of a cellular automata described in the book. The output images are
depict the result of a rule on a starting row and many rows after it.

As an example, here is the elementary cellular automata generated by [rule 110]:
