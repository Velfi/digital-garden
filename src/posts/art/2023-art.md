Art I've done in 2023. I started doing watercolors and linocut prints this year. I'm also practicing my sketching.

I decided to quit playing video games this year, because I was an addict. I would spend hours upon hours gaming instead of doing other things I wanted to do. Even after I stopped having fun in a game, I would find it very difficult to quit. For a large part of my life, games were how I escaped from my problems, and they got me through some really difficult times. However, things are pretty good for me now, and games were keeping me from focusing on activities that actively enrich my life. I don't mean to say that games are bad; Only that they were bad for me.

I've been filling the time with art. My friend Amy has been creating linocut prints for over a year now and I decided to try it out. I really enjoy making them. Carving the linoleum is a very "zen" activity for me. As for the watercolors, I've wanted to learn to paint with watercolors for some time. I'm often too fixated on details at the expense of the whole picture. My difficulty in controlling the watercolors is actually beneficial to me, as it stops me from worrying about the little details.

Working on the block prints and watercolors has shown me how poor my sketching ability is, but I feel it's only a matter of time and practice before I get better. If you wish you could do art, don't delay. Just go be bad at it for as long as it takes to get good. You'll thank yourself later.
