# Plotter Art Generation Suite

The source code is available on [GitHub]

A collection of art generators that can export SVGs. I purchased an [AxiDraw V3] and it's been a lot of fun. Feel free to use these generators to make your own art.

## Running it yourself

Rust is required. To export to SVG, set the `SVG_EXPORT_DIRECTORY` environment variable. The programs support `.env` files.

## Generators

### Line Groups

Run it with this command: `cargo run release --bin line_groups`

The first one I created for this project. It generates groups of lines that look neat.

Run it with this command: `cargo run release --bin maze`
