# Plotter Art Generation Suite

The source code is available on [GitHub]

A collection of art generators that can export SVGs. I purchased an [AxiDraw V3] and it's been a lot of fun. Feel free to use these generators to make your own art. Running it requires you to have Rust installed. To export SVGs, set the `SVG_EXPORT_DIRECTORY` environment variable (you can create an `.env` file in the project root to set this as well).

## Generators

### Line Groups

Run it with this command: `cargo run release --bin line_groups`

The first one I created for this project. It generates groups of lines that look neat. It can also look similar to a [ridgeline plot].

### Maze

Run it with this command: `cargo run release --bin maze`

<Image src="/images/programming/plotlings/maze.svg" alt="An unsolvable maze" width="900" height="655" layout="responsive" />
Based on the classic [maze BASIC program].

### Dune

Run it with this command: `cargo run release --bin dune`
