# Painting flow fields

The source code is available on [GitHub]

This project was born out of a deeper exploration into dimensional noise with the knowledge gained from my [[vector-field-visualizer]] project.
In this app, a dimensional noise feel is used to guide particle that leave a colorful trail behind them. The trails combine over time to reveal the
"flow" of dimensional noise. Several noise algorithms are available to guide the particles. This visualization contains a UI for easy modification of
the app's configuration. Particles can be placed individually by left clicking or painted by holding the right mouse button.

There are also some keyboard controls:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Key</th>
      <th>Action</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Space</td>
      <td>Spawn new particle in a random location</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A</td>
      <td>Toggle On/Off. Automatically spawn a particle every frame unless too many already exist</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>B</td>
      <td>Clear the screen and change the background</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>C</td>
      <td>Switch to the next color palette</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>L</td>
      <td>Switch to the next line cap type</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>N</td>
      <td>Generate a new noise seed and reset the field</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>~</td>
      <td>Show or hide the UI</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

_Note: Because of how the flowing lines are painted, the UI won't immediately disappear and must be painted over, either by changing the background or by painting particles over it._
