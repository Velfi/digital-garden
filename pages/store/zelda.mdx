# Zelda's Store

Thanks for checking out my personal store. I ship all stickers using USPS to anywhere in the US and
they should take 1-2 weeks to arrive **(shipping costs are included in the price.)** I print,
laminate, and cut the stickers myself. They may fade if left outside for a long time and the
laminate may not protect against all liquids. The stickers are shown on my cutting mat which has a
1-inch grid to give you an idea of the size. If you feel like I did you dirty at any point, send an
email with your order info and your grievance to **store** _at_ **zeldas** _dot_ **page**.
