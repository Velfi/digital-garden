# Zelda's Store

> **A note from Zelda:** *I kept things simple when coding this store up meaning you can only purchase stickers from one set per transaction (although you can adjust the quantity on the checkout page.) If you hate this, send an email to **store** *at* **zeldas** *dot* **page** and we'll figure something out.*

Thanks for checking out my personal store. I ship all stickers using USPS to anywhere in the US and they should take 1-2 weeks to arrive **(shipping costs are included in the price.)** I print, laminate, and cut the stickers myself. They may fade if left outside for a long time and the laminate may not protect against all liquids. If you feel like I did you dirty at any point, send an email with your order info and your grievance to **store** _at_ **zeldas** _dot_ **page**.

> **A note from Zelda:** Each image is actually a gallery. You can click on the left or right side of an image to see some extra previews and you can click in the middle to see the full size image. The stickers are shown on my cutting mat which has a 1-inch grid to give you an idea of the size.
