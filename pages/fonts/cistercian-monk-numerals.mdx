# Cistercian Monk Numerals

[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistercian_numerals):

> Cistercian numerals were developed by the Cistercian monastic order in the
> early thirteenth century. These numerals are more compact than Arabic or Roman
> numerals and can indicate any integer from 1 to 9,999 with a single glyph.
>
> The digits are based on a horizontal or vertical stave, and the position of the digit
> on the stave indicates its place value. The Cistercians abandoned the system in favor
> of Arabic numerals, but marginal use continued outside the order until the early
> twentieth century.
>
> The numerals were used for numbering pages, divisions of texts,
> lists, indexes, concordances, arguments in Easter tables, and the lines of a staff in
> musical notation.

8148 is one of my favorites because it looks like a little bodybuilder. 3322 is also good because it looks like
a little anchor. My wife thinks they look like the alien's digits from the movie **Predator**. The numeral is an
