# Pixel Fonts (Atalanta and Rudras)

I wanted to share some of the fonts I’ve been making for my games.

Here’s Atalanta and Rudras. I made them with [BITFONTMAKER2],
an awesome tool for anyone that wants to make a simple bitmap font.
These fonts are free to use under the Creative Commons license so long as
there is attribution, so feel free to include them in your own projects if you like.

## Atalanta

Atalanta is my first custom pixel font that I made for a platformer game.

## Rudras

Rudras is based on the font used in the English fan translation of _Rudra no
Hihou_, a SNES game developed by Square. I was inspired to create a magic spell
creation system based on the Treasure of the Rudras mantra system and I
decided I liked the font too. There are some changes, especially regarding the
numbers, but the styling is consistent in most cases.

## Bonus Wallpaper

I adapted this one from a scene in [Doctor Mordrid].

_(Don’t bother watching it unless you're a fan of Jeffrey Combs; it’s kinda terrible.)_
