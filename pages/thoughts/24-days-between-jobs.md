# Time off between jobs

On August 20th, 2021 I am leaving my job at Tempus for a job at AWS working on the AWS Rust SDK. In the between, I am taking 24 days for leisure time and personal projects. This page is a chronicle of that period.

## August 17th

I rate my own discipline as pretty low, and my attention span isn't much better. I'm compelled to create things because I crave the validation of others. I'm going into this time off with a desire to create something neat and better myself.

I hope to achieve three things:

- I have been following [Raph Levien]'s work for a while now and was reminded of [`druid`][druid] today while reading a thread on orange website. I'd like to build a puzzle game like [Gunpey] with `druid` since everybody's already done Tetris.
  - Bonus points if I can turn this learning experience into a tutorial article.
- I've really been enjoying the outputs of my [[plotlings]]. I'd like to add another generator to it but I'm not sure what yet. I'll likely pick something out that looks nice and the try to recreate it. I'm also interested in implementing a generator that uses Poisson-Disc sampling to do something neat.
  - [Generative Art Python Tutorial for Penplotter]
  - [Aesthetically Pleasing Triangle Subdivision]
  - [Elementary Cellular Automata]
  - [Poisson-Disc Sampling]
  - [Sampling with Polyominoes]
- I want to write, record, and publish (on [YouTube]) a 3-5 minute song. I made a cool bell sound after watching David Bruce's [Why are Composers so Obsessed by Bells?] video and I want to do something with it. My last "song" was all on the Lyra-8 so it's possible I'll bang out another noodle on that noisemaker.
 
### How to build a Gunpey

I think this task will be the most difficult because I've never used `druid` before and the [instructional book] is incomplete. I'm counting on my past experience with creating GUIs for the web and the work I've done with [`conrod`][conrod] for my plotter art generators. If I run into too much trouble, I can switch over to a more familiar framework like [`ggez`][ggez], [`nannou`][nannou], or even [`pixels`][pixels]. This project is also a good opportunity to work on graph traversal algorithms. The object of the game is to build an unbroken line from the left of the screen to the right. An individual segment of the line is valid if it's connected on both sides to either another line or a screen edge. Building that solver will be the first thing that I tackle.
