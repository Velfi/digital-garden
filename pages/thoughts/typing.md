# On Typing

Being a programmer by profession, I spend a great deal of time typing each day. My hands are paying the price for this.

I have good days and bad days. On most days my fingers feel a bit creaky. On a bad day I feel like I never want to touch a keyboard again. Considering also that my two main hobbies are gaming a piano playing, losing my fine motor skills would be pretty hard to deal with.

With that in mind, I purchased an Ergodox Moonlander, a rather esoteric ergonomic keyboard. I've configured it for a Workman layout and I'm struggling through typing lessons. I'm reminded of my poor experience learning touch typing on a QWERTY keyboard all the way back in the first grade. I'm typing this very article at an excruciating 8 words-per-minute but I glimpse occasional rays of hope every once in a while when I can get through a whole word without mistyping it or needing to look at my hands.

- Day 2 (05/15/21):
  - 8 wpm. Struggle, frustration, and woe.
- Day 4 (05/17/21):
  - 14 wpm. Showing some improvement. I used it all day at work.
- Day 7 (05/20/21):
  - 23 wpm. Learning a new keyboard layout has been difficult but not as difficult as I had expected. I changed the modifier key layouts on the keyboard and I am getting pretty comfortable with my [current arrangement][workman-05-20-21]. I can't believe how far I've come in a week.
