# On Digital Gardens

**July 10th, 2021**

I've added so much to this site since starting it a few months ago. I really like this format and the free-flowing nature of the site's navigation. I've wanted to share my thoughts for a while now and it's great to finally feel enabled to do so. If you haven't already, go read [The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral][technopastoral] and start your own digital garden.
