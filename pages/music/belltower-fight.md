# Belltower Fight

Watch/listen on [YouTube]

"Belltower Fight" was an animation I created as part of the [Molto Tutti Student Film Festival].

I composed the music and performed the piano part. Thanks to my teacher [Christy] for recording it, Traci for the Viola part, and Rachel for the Violin part.
I created the animation in [Blender].
