# Shin Megami Tensei Wallpapers

I'm a big nerd when it comes to Atlas JRPGs. They've developed nearly two
Megami Tensei series games a year since they started back in 1987.
The first game in the series that I played was Persona 3 FES,
a spin-off of the Shin Megami Tensei (SMT) main series of games.

I've since also played:

- Persona 4 and 5
- SMT 3: Nocturne,SMT IV, SMT IV: Apocalypse, and SMT V

I couldn't find any desktop backgrounds that I liked from the games so I made some by taking sprites
ripped from the SNES games and scaling them to 1080p. Here they are:

    [Alice, "Alice.png", "Alice"],
    [Alraune, "Alraune.png", "Alraune"],
    [Hecate, "Hecate.png", "Hecate"],
    [Parvati, "Parvati.png", "Parvati"],
    [QueenMab, "Queen_Mab.png", "Queen Mab"],
    [Seiryu, "Seiryu.png", "Seiryu"],
    [SMTII, "smtii.png", "A screenshot from SMT II"],
    [Tiamat, "Tiamat.png", "Tiamat"],
  ]}
