## About This Site

I was inspired by my friend [thatzopoulos] to cultivate a [digital garden]. I love to write and share things but the constraints of dated blog posts in a reverse-chronological timeline has always felt wrong to me.

This "digital garden" is my attempt to thwart any feelings of "not producing _content_" because _content_ is not what I'm about.

The pages of this site will continually grow and change.
I hope you find them amusing, educational, useful, and interesting.
