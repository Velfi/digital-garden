## About This Site

I was inspired by my friend [thatzopoulos] to cultivate a [digital garden]. I love to write and
share things but the constraints of dated blog posts in a reverse-chronological timeline has always
felt wrong to me.

This "digital garden" is my attempt to thwart any feelings of "not producing _content_" because _content_ is not what I'm about.

The pages of this site will continually grow and change.
I hope you find them amusing, educational, useful, and interesting.

## My Store

**_New! Wow! Amazing! [I sell stickers!](store/zelda)_**

I love stickers and collect them. I recently purchased a printer and a cutting robot and started
making my own. Most of them are images that I generated with DALL\*E. I sell them in 1-sheet packs
for $20 apiece. Shipping is included and if we're already friends then local pickup is available.

## Footnotes

This site was originally based on [this template][site-template] but I've since made so many changes
at this point that there's barely anything left of the original framework.
